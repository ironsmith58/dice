python module:RPG game dice parser/roller

Many table top role playing games (RPG) use dice to generate random numbers.  There are many types of dice based on Plato's regular solids.  Games may require multiple dice to be rolled.  To show this in a succinct manner the nomenclature 3d6 has become the de facto standard.

This parser can parse dice specifications like;
- 3d6
- 1d4+1
- 2d20+8*10
